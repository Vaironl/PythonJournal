This application should help me to build a simple Python application from start to end, it is the first in a series of applications to help me hone my skills as a software developer. I will attempt to refactor the code and create applications that adhere to standards rather than just something that works and looks horrible. Warning: my code might still look like a behemoth, but I will attempt to improve this overtime.
